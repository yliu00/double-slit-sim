# double-slit-sim
Simulation of the double slit experiment


## Formulas used:
Wave Equation (reduced): y(x) = A * cos(pi * x/lambda)
- y = vertical height
- x = horizontal pos
- A = amplitude
- lambda = wavelength

Intensity = max intensity * cos^2(beta) * (sin(alpha)/alpha)^2
- if screen is placed far enough from the slits:
  - alpha = (pi * a * y)/(lambda * L)
  - beta = (pi * d * y)/(lambda * L)
- a = size of slit
- d = distance between slits
- lambda = wavelength
- theta = angle along a line perpendicular to screen
- y = distance along the screen (middle = 0)
- L = length to screen
